# Introduction {#ch:intro}

Visual inference on the residuals diagnostics of linear mixed models. 

Focus on

- normality QQ plot for least confounded residual vs conditional residual for marginal residuals
- conditional residual in marginal residual v.s conditional residual

This is where you introduce the main ideas of your thesis, and an overview of the context and background.

Later chapters should be divided into coherent pieces describing your analysis. The final chapter should provide some concluding remarks, discussion, ideas for future research, and so on. Appendixes can contain additional material that don't fit into any chapters, but that you want to put on record. For example, additional tables, output, etc.
