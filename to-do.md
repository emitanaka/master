# To do list 

* By week 1 Thu:
  * incoporate mixed models derivation and summary in Chapter 1 of thesis template.
  * go through Adam Loy's script and `case1-agdata.Rmd`. Replicate result for Loy's script. Expand latter to have diagnostics like Loy's
  
* By week 4 Thu:
  * simulating data for the null plots from model fit
  * null plots - lineup
  
* By week 5 Thu:
  * `xaringan` package - slides
  
* By week 7 Tue:
  * Presentation

* By week 7 Thu:
  * Find 2-3 dataset
  
* By week 8 Thu:
  * Continue on `MathAchieve` data set
  * Write the content
  * Do shiny app
  
* By week 9 Thu:
  
  * 3 datasets -> 
    1. Fit most appropriate -> do diagnostics and find "best" model 
    2. Simulate data based on this "best" model fit:
       * simulate 3 scenarios of data
            - version 1: generate from the "best" model
            - version 2: introduce some slight noise or deviation from the model
            - version 3: more extreme deviation from the model
       * replicate of each scenario 
       * which plot to use? QQ-plot, index vs. residual for conditional vs. least confounded residual
 * Draw your experimental diagram (see Appendix A of https://github.com/srkobakian/experiment/blob/master/protocol.pdf)
